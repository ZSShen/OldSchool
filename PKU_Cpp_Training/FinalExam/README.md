### Practice Comment

#### Part3
+ The problem is to implement a summation function. But it is also worth to practice:  
  + Implement the template function object.  
  + Implement the summation template function with helper object.  

#### Part6
+ The problem is to implement the `MyString` class. But it is also worth to practice:  
  + Implement the array smart pointer.  
  + Implement the exception safe constructor.  

#### Part7
+ The problem is to implement:
  + The `for_each()` template function.  
  + The template function object for container order comparison.  

#### Part9
+ The problem is to implement:
  + The inheritance class pair.  
  + The comparator object for `std::set`.  
  + The helper object for `for_each` template function.
